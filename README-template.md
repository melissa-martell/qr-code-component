## My process
I first started with the structure on index.html and the move to the style sheet.
I use de @import method to apply the correct typography and two urls, one for de font weigth 400 and another for the 700.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I remember that I can use typography by @import and not downloading the file, eventhough it seems slower to load the page

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat&family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap');
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@700&family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap');
```

### Continued development

I will study flex propeties like flex shrink and flex grow
